      I've been on dating apps for 2 years and I'm exhausted. Every conversation
      goes nowhere. Is modern dating just broken?

      My partner says if I really loved them I would stop talking to my friends.
      They say I'm being selfish by wanting time with other people. Maybe they're right?

      Everyone keeps telling me to just love myself before I can love someone else.
      But that feels impossible when I'm lonely. Is this advice actually helpful?
