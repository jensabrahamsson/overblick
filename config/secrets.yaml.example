# Överblick Secrets Configuration
# ================================
# Copy this file to config/secrets/<identity>.yaml for each identity.
# NEVER commit actual secret files to version control!
#
# To encrypt values in place:
#   python -m overblick secrets encrypt
#
# Encrypted values will be Fernet-encrypted and can only be
# decrypted with the key stored in OVERBLICK_SECRET_KEY env var.
#
# Each identity gets its own secrets file under config/secrets/.
# Only include the secrets relevant to that identity's plugins.
