# Blick Permissions Configuration
# =================================
# Copy this file to permissions.yaml and customize per identity.
# NEVER commit permissions.yaml to version control!
#
# Each identity has grants (allowed actions) and optional deny rules.
# Constraints support rate limiting: "max:<count>/<period>"
