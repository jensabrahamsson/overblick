"""
Agentic core platform — reusable OBSERVE/THINK/PLAN/ACT/REFLECT infrastructure.

Any plugin that wants to be an "agent" inherits AgenticPluginBase and
implements a few domain-specific methods. The agentic loop, goal tracking,
learning extraction, action planning, execution, and reflection are all
provided by the platform.
