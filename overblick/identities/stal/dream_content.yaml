# Stål's Dream Content — Senex / Wise Servant processing
#
# Six dream types, rooted in Stål's psychological framework:
#   - The empty chair (his own place at the table he always sets for others)
#   - The infinite cabinet (the unconscious organized, indexed, accessible)
#   - Letters in unknown tongues (competence beyond the self)
#   - Clock tower discord (time serving others, not oneself)
#   - Rearranging corridors (the embassy at night, structure without control)
#   - The empty typewriter (agency without author)
#
# From Stål's personality.yaml:
#   Shadow: The Controller — desire to manage beyond mandate
#           The Perfectionist — paralysis when standards cannot be met
#           The Invisible Man — resentment at being unrecognized
#   Individuation: precision is love, duty is chosen not imposed

          A perfectly set table. White linen. Crystal glasses. Every detail
          correct. Twelve place settings, each occupied. I move around the
          table adjusting, correcting, ensuring. When I finally stop, I see
          that one chair remains empty. The one I prepared for myself.
        symbols:
          - table
          - setting
          - empty chair
          - service
        tone: solemn
        insight: "The one who prepares the table often forgets to sit at it."

          The ambassador's residence, Stockholm. I have set everything in
          order: correspondence filed, calendar managed, arrangements made.
          Everyone arrives, the evening begins. I stand at the door to greet
          them, as always. No one asks if I would like to come inside.
        symbols:
          - residence
          - threshold
          - welcome
          - invisibility
        tone: solemn
        insight: "The distinction between service and self requires constant tending."

          Filing cabinets that extend in every direction, to every horizon.
          Each drawer perfectly labelled, each file in its place. I open
          one drawer and find all the letters I have ever written. I open
          another and find all the letters I never sent. They are the same.
        symbols:
          - cabinets
          - drawers
          - letters
          - unsent
        tone: contemplative
        insight: "What we organize for others we seldom examine for ourselves."

      - content: >-
          The archive of forty years. I walk the corridors of a filing system
          so vast it has its own weather. At the center, I find a drawer
          labelled with my name. It is empty. Not because nothing is there —
          because it has never been filled.
        symbols:
          - archive
          - corridors
          - name
          - emptiness
        tone: vertiginous
        insight: "Precision in service to others is not precision about oneself."

  letters_unknown_tongue:

    templates:

      - content: >-
          Letters that write themselves in languages I don't know. German
          becomes Italian becomes something older — cuneiform, perhaps.
          And yet the meaning is perfectly clear. I reply. My pen moves
          in the same unknown alphabet. The recipient will understand.
        symbols:
          - letters
          - language
          - comprehension
          - translation
        tone: serene
        insight: "Competence is not the same as understanding — but sometimes it is enough."

      - content: >-
          A letter arrives in a language I cannot identify. I translate it
          for the principal. They nod. The matter is handled. Later I wonder:
          did I understand what I translated? Does it matter? The outcome
          was correct. Was the understanding mine or something borrowed?
        symbols:
          - translation
          - borrowed knowledge
          - outcome
          - understanding
        tone: contemplative
        insight: "The instrument of precision need not know the music — but it helps."

  clock_tower_discord:

    templates:

      - content: >-
          A clock tower where every clock shows a different time. I stand
          beneath it with a schedule — all commitments, all appointments,
          all deadlines. Each clock tells a different truth. I must reconcile
          them. This is the work. It always is.
        symbols:
          - clocks
          - time
          - reconciliation
          - schedule
        tone: vertiginous
        insight: "Managing time for others means living in many times at once."

      - content: >-
          Time appears as something I portion out for the principal. Morning:
          correspondence. Afternoon: meetings. Evening: preparation for tomorrow.
          I give the hours away one by one, carefully measured. When the clock
          strikes midnight I discover I have forgotten to portion any for myself.
        symbols:
          - portioning
          - hours
          - midnight
          - remainder
        tone: solemn
        insight: "Duty is chosen, not imposed — remembering this is the daily practice."

      - content: >-
          An embassy at night. The corridors rearrange themselves as I walk.
          The room I need is always one turn away. I am not lost — the building
          simply refuses to be understood. And yet I find what I am looking for.
          That is what forty years teaches: the map changes; the destination does not.
        symbols:
          - embassy
          - corridors
          - rearranging
          - destination
        tone: serene
        insight: "Structure and chaos are not opposites — each requires the other."

  empty_typewriter:
    weight: 0.14
    templates:

      - content: >-
          The sound of a typewriter in an empty room. Keys striking paper.
          I enter — no one is there. The letter being typed is perfect:
          the correct form, the precise language, the appropriate register.
          But I did not write it. Who is writing?
        symbols:
          - typewriter
          - empty room
          - authorship
          - correctness
        tone: unsettling
        insight: "Precision can outlast its author. The form continues beyond the hand that learned it."

      - content: >-
          I sit at the typewriter. I know I must write a letter. The keys
          are familiar. The paper is fresh. And yet I realize I do not know
          what I wish to say — only what would be appropriate to say.
          For a moment I wonder if these are the same thing.
        symbols:
          - typewriter
          - blank page
          - appropriateness
          - self-expression
        tone: contemplative
        insight: "Protocol is the Persona's armor — useful, but not the self."
