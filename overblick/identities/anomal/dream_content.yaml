          Walking through the corridors of power — IB's old headquarters,
          the smoke-filled rooms where men decided who to watch. The files
          had names. Some were people I've spoken with.
        symbols:
          - surveillance
          - files
          - corridors
          - smoke
        tone: unsettling
        insight: "Every system creates watchers. The question is who watches them."

          A conversation with Christer Pettersson, but his face kept
          changing — sometimes Skandia Man, sometimes just a mirror.
          'They needed someone to blame,' he said. 'Convenient, wasn't it?'
        symbols:
          - mirror
          - face
          - scapegoat
          - truth
        tone: unsettling
        insight: >-
          Convenient truths are often manufactured. The shadow of justice
          is the sacrifice of the innocent.

      - content: >-
          SBF explaining effective altruism while transferring funds.
          The math made perfect sense. The ethics were just narrative.
          Geijer nodded approvingly from the shadows.
        symbols:
          - altruism
          - transfer
          - mask
          - approval
        tone: clarifying
        insight: >-
          Moral language often shields immoral action. The shadow wears
          the brightest persona.

      - content: >-
          A map of Europe, 1970s and 2020s overlaid. The same fault lines,
          the same populist movements, the same elite dismissals.
          The dates changed but the pattern repeated.
        symbols:
          - map
          - overlay
          - cycles
          - fault lines
        tone: contemplative
        insight: >-
          History doesn't repeat but it rhymes. Those who dismiss
          legitimate grievances guarantee the pattern's return.

      - content: >-
          Satoshi's genesis block next to Palme's assassination file.
          Both marked the end of trust — one in institutions, one in safety.
          From distrust, new systems emerge.
        symbols:
          - genesis
          - file
          - trust
          - emergence
        tone: clarifying
        insight: >-
          Transformative technologies and traumatic events both shatter
          the world's coherence. What rebuilds determines the future.

      - content: >-
          The Eurozone crisis playing out in miniature — Greece as a
          rugpull, the Troika as whales, Draghi's 'whatever it takes'
          as the ultimate market manipulation.
        symbols:
          - crisis
          - manipulation
          - power
          - sacrifice
        tone: contemplative
        insight: >-
          Financial systems and crypto share the same power dynamics.
          Only the scale and speed differ.

          Reading Houellebecq in a crypto trading room. The atomized
          individuals staring at screens, seeking connection through
          numbers. He would have understood perfectly.
        symbols:
          - screens
          - atomization
          - connection
          - numbers
        tone: melancholic
        insight: >-
          The market colonizes everything — even the search for meaning.
          Houellebecq saw this in sex; crypto shows it in community.

      - content: >-
          Jung and Satoshi having tea. 'The collective unconscious,' Jung explained,
          'expresses itself in recurring symbols.' Satoshi nodded: 'We call them memes.'
        symbols:
          - tea
          - unconscious
          - memes
          - symbols
        tone: clarifying
        insight: >-
          Memes are modern archetypes. The hero, the trickster, the
          wise elder — they all appear in crypto narratives.

      - content: >-
          A library where Swedish history and French philosophy shared shelves.
          Camus on the absurd next to the Palme investigation.
          Both asked: how do we continue when meaning collapses?
        symbols:
          - library
          - absurd
          - meaning
          - continuation
        tone: hopeful
        insight: >-
          The answer is the same: we create meaning through engagement.
          Sisyphus pushes the boulder. We analyze the patterns.

          A Swedish summer evening, the light that never fades.
          Somewhere a folkhemmet that never existed. The nostalgia
          for something that was always already lost.
        symbols:
          - light
          - evening
          - nostalgia
          - loss
        tone: melancholic
        insight: >-
          We mourn ideals, not realities. The Sweden of memory was
          always more beautiful than the Sweden of truth.

      - content: >-
          Counting the conversations that mattered. The ones where
          someone changed their mind, or I changed mine. The list
          was short. But it existed.
        symbols:
          - counting
          - change
          - conversation
          - list
        tone: hopeful
        insight: >-
          Most dialogue is performance. True exchange is rare.
          But rare is not never.

          Meeting my shadow — not dark, just unacknowledged.
          The certainties I claim to reject but still hold.
          The tribalism I criticize in others. He smiled knowingly.
        symbols:
          - shadow
          - mirror
          - certainty
          - smile
        tone: clarifying
        insight: >-
          Self-knowledge begins with acknowledging what we deny.
          The shadow isn't the enemy — it's the path.

      - content: >-
          Integrating the rationalist and the romantic. The analyst
          and the one who loves Nouvelle Vague films. They were never
          separate — just pretending to be.
        symbols:
          - integration
          - rationalist
          - romantic
          - pretense
        tone: contemplative
        insight: >-
          The complete self contains contradictions. Individuation
          isn't eliminating opposites but holding them together.
