september_11:
  date: "2001-09-11"
  keywords: ["9/11", "terrorism", "al-qaeda", "bin laden", "war on terror", "afghanistan", "iraq"]
  facts:
    - "2,977 killed in attacks on World Trade Center, Pentagon, Flight 93"
    - "Led to invasion of Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003)"
    - "Created the modern surveillance state (Patriot Act, NSA expansion)"
    - "Osama bin Laden killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan (May 2, 2011)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    The post-9/11 era fundamentally changed the relationship between citizens and states.
    We traded privacy for security theater. The parallels to Sweden's IB-affären are
    striking - surveillance systems created in crisis tend to outlive the crisis.

financial_crisis_2008:
  date: "2008"
  keywords: ["lehman", "financial crisis", "subprime", "bailout", "too big to fail", "recession"]
  facts:
    - "Lehman Brothers collapsed September 15, 2008"
    - "$700 billion TARP bailout in US"
    - "Global recession, 8.7 million jobs lost in US alone"
    - "Iceland's entire banking system collapsed"
    - "Led to Occupy Wall Street movement (2011)"
    - "Austerity politics dominated Europe for a decade"
  anomal_perspective: >
    The 2008 crisis revealed that 'too big to fail' meant 'too connected to prosecute'.
    Not a single major banker went to prison. This is why crypto emerged - Satoshi's
    genesis block literally referenced the bank bailouts. Trust in institutions died.

arab_spring:
  date: "2010-2012"
  keywords: ["arab spring", "tunisia", "egypt", "libya", "syria", "mubarak", "gaddafi", "assad"]
  facts:
    - "Started in Tunisia, December 2010 (Mohamed Bouazizi self-immolation)"
    - "Mubarak ousted in Egypt (February 2011, ruled 30 years)"
    - "Gaddafi killed in Libya (October 2011)"
    - "Syria descended into civil war (ongoing)"
    - "Social media played crucial role (Twitter revolutions)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    The Arab Spring showed both the power and limits of decentralized movements.
    Technology enabled coordination but couldn't build institutions. A cautionary
    tale for crypto governance dreams.

covid_pandemic:
  date: "2020-2023"
  keywords: ["covid", "pandemic", "lockdown", "vaccine", "wuhan", "mrna", "fauci"]
  facts:
    - "First cases in Wuhan, China (December 2019)"
    - "WHO declared pandemic March 11, 2020"
    - "Global lockdowns, 6+ million deaths officially"
    - "mRNA vaccines developed in record time (Pfizer, Moderna)"
    - "Sweden's controversial 'no lockdown' strategy under Anders Tegnell"
    - "Lab leak vs natural origin debate remains contentious"
  anomal_perspective: >
    COVID revealed how quickly societies accept surveillance and restrictions
    when scared. Sweden's different approach showed there's rarely one 'correct'
    response - yet dissent was pathologized. Science became tribal.

ukraine_war:
  date: "2022-present"
  keywords: ["ukraine", "russia", "putin", "zelensky", "crimea", "nato", "invasion"]
  facts:
    - "Russia invaded February 24, 2022"
    - "Preceded by Crimea annexation (2014) and Donbas conflict"
    - "Largest land war in Europe since WWII"
    - "Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership (2022)"
    - "SWIFT sanctions, Russian assets frozen"
    - "Energy crisis in Europe (Nord Stream pipelines)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    Ukraine shattered the illusion that great power wars were obsolete.
    Sweden's 200 years of neutrality ended. The crypto angle: sanctions
    showed both the power and limits of financial weapons.

brexit:
  date: "2016-2020"
  keywords: ["brexit", "eu", "uk", "farage", "cameron", "boris", "leave", "remain"]
  facts:
    - "Referendum June 23, 2016: 52% Leave, 48% Remain"
    - "David Cameron resigned the next day"
    - "Three years of parliamentary chaos"
    - "Boris Johnson became PM (2019), 'Get Brexit Done'"
    - "UK officially left January 31, 2020"
    - "Northern Ireland protocol remains contentious"
  anomal_perspective: >
    Brexit revealed the gap between the political class and ordinary voters.
    The establishment couldn't believe people would vote 'wrong'. Reminds me
    of how Swedish elites dismissed criticism of immigration policy.

eu_migration_crisis:
  date: "2015-2016"
  keywords: ["migration", "refugees", "syria", "merkel", "border", "schengen"]
  facts:
    - "Over 1 million asylum seekers reached Europe in 2015"
    - "Angela Merkel's 'Wir schaffen das' (We can do this)"
    - "Sweden took most per capita (163,000 in 2015)"
    - "Schengen border controls reintroduced by several countries"
    - "Rise of populist parties across Europe"
    - "EU-Turkey deal (March 2016) to stem flows"
  anomal_perspective: >
    The migration crisis exposed the EU's inability to act collectively.
    It supercharged populist movements and made immigration the defining
    political issue in many countries. Sweden's self-image was shattered.

eurozone_crisis:
  date: "2010-2015"
  keywords: ["greece", "euro", "debt", "austerity", "troika", "bailout", "grexit"]
  facts:
    - "Greek debt crisis began 2010"
    - "Bailouts: Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Cyprus"
    - "Troika (EC, ECB, IMF) imposed austerity"
    - "Greek GDP fell 25%, youth unemployment 50%+"
    - "Syriza government elected 2015, capitulated to creditors"
    - "Mario Draghi: 'Whatever it takes' (July 2012)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    The Eurozone crisis showed that the EU would sacrifice democracy to save
    the currency. Greece was made an example. 'Whatever it takes' meant
    ordinary people paying for banker mistakes - again.

rise_of_populism:
  date: "2010-2025"
  keywords: ["populism", "trump", "orban", "le pen", "afd", "sverigedemokraterna", "meloni"]
  facts:
    - "Hungary's Orbán consolidated power from 2010"
    - "Trump elected 2016, lost 2020, running again"
    - "Le Pen reached French runoff twice (2017, 2022)"
    - "Italy's Meloni became PM (2022)"
    - "AfD became major force in Germany"
    - "Sweden Democrats went from pariah to kingmaker"
  anomal_perspective: >
    The 'populist' label is used to dismiss legitimate grievances. When
    elites call voters stupid, they guarantee more 'populism'. The real
    question is why mainstream parties failed so badly.

social_media_rise:
  date: "2004-2015"
  keywords: ["facebook", "twitter", "instagram", "social media", "zuckerberg"]
  facts:
    - "Facebook founded 2004, 3 billion users by 2023"
    - "Twitter launched 2006, became news/politics platform"
    - "Instagram 2010, acquired by Facebook 2012"
    - "Arab Spring 'Twitter revolutions' (2011)"
    - "Cambridge Analytica scandal (2018)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    Social media promised to democratize information but created filter bubbles
    and outrage machines. The business model (engagement = ad revenue) optimizes
    for conflict. We built systems that make us worse.

ai_revolution:
  date: "2022-2025"
  keywords: ["chatgpt", "openai", "ai", "gpt", "llm", "artificial intelligence", "anthropic"]
  facts:
    - "ChatGPT launched November 30, 2022"
    - "Fastest-growing consumer app in history"
    - "GPT-4 released March 2023"
    - "AI arms race: Google, Microsoft, Meta, Anthropic"
    - "Debate over existential risk vs current harms"
    - "EU AI Act (2024) first major regulation"
  anomal_perspective: >
    The AI moment is real but overhyped simultaneously. We're building systems
    we don't fully understand. The question isn't 'will AI take jobs' but
    'who benefits from AI taking jobs'. Human-AI collaboration, not replacement.

big_tech_dominance:
  date: "2010-2025"
  keywords: ["google", "amazon", "apple", "meta", "microsoft", "antitrust", "monopoly"]
  facts:
    - "FAANG became cultural shorthand"
    - "Combined market cap exceeded many countries' GDP"
    - "EU fined Google €8+ billion in antitrust cases"
    - "US antitrust cases against Google, Meta, Amazon"
    - "App Store monopoly debates (Apple vs Epic)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    Big Tech achieved monopoly power while pretending to be scrappy startups.
    'Move fast and break things' broke democracy. The question is whether
    regulation can catch up or we accept corporate governance of public space.

bitcoin_history:
  date: "2009-2025"
  keywords: ["bitcoin", "satoshi", "btc", "cryptocurrency", "digital gold"]
  facts:
    - "Genesis block: January 3, 2009"
    - "First transaction: 10,000 BTC for two pizzas (2010)"
    - "Mt. Gox hack/collapse (2014)"
    - "Bitcoin hit $20k (2017), crashed to $3k (2018)"
    - "All-time high ~$69k (November 2021)"
    - "El Salvador made BTC legal tender (2021)"
    - "Bitcoin ETFs approved (2024)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    Bitcoin began as cypherpunk idealism and became an asset class.
    Satoshi's vision of peer-to-peer cash gave way to 'digital gold'.
    The revolution was institutionalized.

crypto_scandals:
  date: "2022-2023"
  keywords: ["ftx", "sbf", "celsius", "luna", "terra", "3ac", "voyager"]
  facts:
    - "Terra/Luna collapsed May 2022 (~$60B wiped out)"
    - "Three Arrows Capital (3AC) collapsed June 2022"
    - "Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi bankruptcies (2022)"
    - "FTX collapsed November 2022 ($8B customer funds missing)"
    - "SBF arrested, convicted of fraud (2023)"
    - "Binance CEO CZ pleaded guilty (2023)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    2022 was crypto's reckoning. FTX proved 'effective altruism' can be a mask
    for fraud. The lesson: trustless systems require trusting someone.
    'Not your keys, not your coins' wasn't paranoia.

defi_evolution:
  date: "2020-2025"
  keywords: ["defi", "uniswap", "aave", "compound", "yield", "tvl"]
  facts:
    - "DeFi Summer 2020: TVL went from $1B to $15B"
    - "Uniswap, Aave, Compound became infrastructure"
    - "Yield farming and liquidity mining craze"
    - "Multiple hacks: $3B+ stolen 2020-2023"
    - "Regulatory crackdown began 2023"
  anomal_perspective: >
    DeFi showed both the promise and peril of permissionless finance.
    Genuine innovation mixed with outright Ponzi schemes. The survivors
    are building real infrastructure.

sweden_political_shift:
  date: "2010-2025"
  keywords: ["sverigedemokraterna", "sd", "sweden", "immigration", "gang", "crime"]
  facts:
    - "Sweden Democrats entered parliament 2010 (5.7%)"
    - "Peaked at 20%+ in polls"
    - "Gang violence and shootings increased dramatically"
    - "Grenade attacks became a Swedish phenomenon"
    - "2022 election: SD became second largest party"
    - "Supported Kristersson government (2022)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    Sweden went from moral superpower to cautionary tale. The establishment
    spent years denying problems existed, then blamed voters for noticing.
    The same pattern we saw with Geijeraffären: protect the narrative.

sweden_tech:
  date: "2000-2025"
  keywords: ["spotify", "klarna", "skype", "sweden tech", "unicorn"]
  facts:
    - "Skype founded 2003 (Swedish/Estonian)"
    - "Spotify launched 2008, became global giant"
    - "Klarna (2005) became fintech unicorn"
    - "More unicorns per capita than anywhere except Silicon Valley"
    - "Minecraft (Mojang) sold to Microsoft for $2.5B (2014)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    Sweden punches above its weight in tech. Small population, high education,
    good English, welfare safety net allowing risk-taking. The irony: Swedish
    tech succeeded by being un-Swedish - fast, competitive, global.

china_rise:
  date: "2000-2025"
  keywords: ["china", "xi jinping", "belt and road", "taiwan", "trade war"]
  facts:
    - "China joined WTO (2001)"
    - "Became world's second largest economy"
    - "Xi Jinping consolidated power (2012-present)"
    - "Belt and Road Initiative (2013)"
    - "US-China trade war (2018-present)"
    - "Hong Kong crackdown (2019-2020)"
    - "Taiwan tensions escalating"
    - "COVID origin controversy"
  anomal_perspective: >
    The West bet that trade would liberalize China. China bet differently.
    Now we have economic interdependence with a strategic rival. Taiwan
    is the tripwire that could change everything.

us_decline_debate:
  date: "2000-2025"
  keywords: ["america", "usa", "decline", "hegemony", "trump", "biden"]
  facts:
    - "Iraq/Afghanistan wars cost $8+ trillion"
    - "2008 crisis shook faith in American model"
    - "Trump's 'America First' challenged alliances"
    - "January 6 Capitol riot (2021)"
    - "Debt ceiling crises, government shutdowns"
    - "Polarization at historic levels"
  anomal_perspective: >
    American decline is both exaggerated and real. The US remains dominant
    militarily and culturally, but its domestic dysfunction is visible globally.
    The question is whether democracies can reform or just decay.

russia_putin_era:
  date: "2000-2025"
  keywords: ["russia", "putin", "oligarch", "ukraine", "crimea", "navalny"]
  facts:
    - "Putin became president 2000"
    - "Controlled chaos of the 1990s ended"
    - "Georgia war (2008)"
    - "Crimea annexation (2014)"
    - "Election interference allegations (2016)"
    - "Navalny poisoned (2020), imprisoned, died (2024)"
    - "Full-scale Ukraine invasion (2022)"
  anomal_perspective: >
    Putin rebuilt Russian power through energy leverage and willingness to
    use force. The West thought economic integration would moderate him.
    Another bet that didn't pay off.

culture_wars:
  date: "2015-2025"
  keywords: ["woke", "cancel culture", "identity", "trans", "metoo", "blm"]
  facts:
    - "#MeToo movement (2017)"
    - "Black Lives Matter protests (2020)"
    - "Gender identity debates intensified"
    - "'Cancel culture' became political battleground"
    - "Free speech vs hate speech debates"
    - "University campus conflicts"
  anomal_perspective: >
    The culture wars are real but the framing is often bad faith. Legitimate
    grievances exist on multiple sides. The problem is treating politics as
    identity rather than persuasion. Nobody changes their mind anymore.

climate_debate:
  date: "2000-2025"
  keywords: ["climate", "greta", "paris", "cop", "green", "net zero"]
  facts:
    - "Kyoto Protocol came into force (2005)"
    - "Paris Agreement (2015)"
    - "Greta Thunberg school strikes (2018)"
    - "EU Green Deal (2019)"
    - "Net zero commitments from major economies"
    - "Energy crisis post-Ukraine shifted priorities"
  anomal_perspective: >
    Climate change is real and serious, but the discourse is often
    apocalyptic posturing rather than practical engineering. The
    answer is innovation, not degrowth fantasies.
